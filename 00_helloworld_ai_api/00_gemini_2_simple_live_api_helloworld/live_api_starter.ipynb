            "    * **Text:** Books, articles, emails, social media posts.\n",
            "    * **Images:** Photos, videos, medical scans.\n",
            "    * **Audio:** Music, speech, sound effects.\n",
            "    * **Numerical Data:** Sales figures, stock prices, sensor readings.\n",
            "    * **Categorical Data:** Product types, user demographics, survey responses.\n",

            "**1. Rule-Based Systems (Simple Logic):**\n",
            "\n",
            "* **How it works:** Programmers explicitly define rules for the AI to follow. For example, \"IF temperature is above 30°C, THEN turn on the AC.\"\n",

            "* **Key Idea:**  Deep learning algorithms can automatically extract features from data, meaning they can learn very nuanced patterns that traditional machine learning might miss.\n",
            "* **Pros:**  Highly powerful for complex tasks, can often achieve state-of-the-art performance.\n",
            "* **Cons:**  Requires massive amounts of data and computational resources, can be a \"black box\" making it hard to understand why it makes specific decisions.\n",

            "* **Inference (or Prediction):** Using the trained model to make predictions on new data.\n",
